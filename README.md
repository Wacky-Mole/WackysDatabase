Description

WackysDatabase, or Wackydb, allows you to modify and customize items, pieces, recipes, effects, materials and creatures in Valheim without coding. With this mod, you can **clone** items, change their colors, create new items, and even translate language. It offers a wide range of possibilities for customization.


YML Knowledge

    YML is easier to edit and change without getting confused on the syntac. 

 You can use https://www.yamllint.com/ to validate any yml code

    Almost every component of items/pieces/recipes/effects/creatures can be deleted.

    Some components are multilined where you can actually add your own stuff the ymls.********

<details><summary>Installation</summary>
### Installation****

    Download and extract the latest version of WackysDatabase into the BepInEx plugin folder (usually Valheim/BepInEx/plugins).
    Run Valheim and join a world.
    Go to Valheim/BepInEx/config/ and locate the "wackysDatabase" folder.
    Inside the "wackysDatabase" folder, you will find three subfolders: "Items," "Recipes," and "Pieces."
    Put the mod on the server to force server sync. The YAML files only need to be on the server. There's no need to share the YAML files.

For multiplayer, the mod has been locked down to prevent easy cheating. However, it is recommended to use the AzuAntiCheat and ServerCharacters mods for additional security.

<details><summary>General Knowledge</summary>


    There are five (6) Objects that WackyDB touches. Items, Recipes, Pieces, Creatures,  Materials and Textures

    Items are things in your inventory, you can pickup and maybe equip them.

    Recipes are used to construct items, CraftingStations can be workbench, forge, or hand crafted (craftingStation": "")

    Pieces are what you use in your hammer and hoe to construct or plant. piecehammers

    Creatures are mobs, bosses ect.

    Materials are the basic "colors" in the game, but hold a lot more than just RBG, can they can be tricky to get just right.

    Textures are .pngs that hold the feel, appearance, or consistency of a surface or substance.

    Nost lines in the YAMLS can be deleted. Only the required ones need to be in the files, when the line is deleted the computer interprets that as a null value.

    Null is like I don't know, so I don't care, use the orginal values. 
    
    To delete the existing values you will use either '' for strings, "delete" for SE Effects or "-" for multiliners. 

    jpeg or png. 64 x 64 px - name like wacky.png, Must be in Icon Folder (Not ServerSynced)

Frequently Asked Questions

    Q: Can I use custom icons for items?
        A: Yes, you can use autogenerated icons or provide JPEG/PNG icons (64x64) for customization.

    Q: Can I add new items with this mod?
        A: Yes, you can create new items and make them exclusive.

    Q: Can I remove components from YAML files?
        A: Yes, most components can be removed from the YAML files.

    Q: Is the mod future-proof?
        A: Yes, you can add or remove components without much hassle.

    Q: Does the Water resistant not work on set effect? Like m_mods: m_type: Water
        A: Water is a DamageModifiers that I added from Aedenthorn mod.  I don't have plans to add it to m_mods.
        
    Q: Do you have a Video;
        A: Not yet, but YOU could make one!

    Q: Is it possible to add a recipe for each upgrade of an item?
        A: Recipes are at a weird place in wackydb. I might split it out into a submod, but I am not sure yet. 

    Q: My weapon clones are speedup/speed down. 
        A: The clones speed can change a little bit from their parents. Custom_AttackSpeed should always be 1 on a save. 
        If you notice a speed up or down a +- 0.1 should fix it.  
        FYI reminder that SpeedFactor deals with character movement speed while swinging/attacking and has nothing to do with speed of animation.

    Q: What Folders do I need to give to my users?
        A: Textures, Objects, Icons will NOT SYNC. I also recommend including the cache folder. Cache keeps track of Item/mock clones and materials

    Q: How can I export material without _mat suffix ? I succeeded to export draugr_mat, but how for goblin or greydwarves ? 
        A: It's is unfortunely not possible right now to get all of the mats because of how the devs named and made different things.
            If you have access to Unity you could look at the files themselves. 

    Q: What lines can I delete or how can I make somethings empty?
        A: This is a long answer, but most lines in the YAMLS can be deleted. Only the required ones need to be in the files, when the line is deleted the computer interprets that as a null value.
            Null is like I don't know, so I don't care, use the orginal values. To delete the existing values you will use either '' for strings, "delete" for SE Effects or "-" for multiliners. 

    Q: How do I make custom Icons?
        A: Make a png or jpeg 64 x 64 px. Put it in Icons folder. In the customIcon line, put the filename. ie. wacky.png

![Custom Icon Gif](https://wackymole.com/hosts/customicon.gif)


    Q: Will there be even MORE features and can I edit effects?
        A: No, probably not. 

    Q: Why are some of the SE Effects empty? Like SeData?
        A: Well its complicated, I am having to grab them in a weird way, and not all SEs have SeData. Nothing to be done about it. 

    Q: What about Attack Projectile?
        A: I need to look at projectiles in the future, for now they are disabled.

    Q: Would it be possible to have one item take 2+ different item slots ? (say weapon + pants)
        A: No, but you can edit two parts and one effect, which is effective when combined!
        If one of them is missing, then the two pieces of equipment have no effect, which can be regarded as a limitation

    Q:  On an item "name" is the prefab name, "m_name" is the in game name? Then on recipes, "name" is the name of the prefab item name?
        A: Correct on both. For cloned recipes, it looks at cloneprefabname, recipe name needs to be unique

<details><summary> Cache System </summary>


<img src="https://wackymole.com/hosts/MainMenu.png" />

## Cache Folder


The cache system is very important for Item/mock clones. 

It allows material colors to show up on main menu and allows cloned items to be touched by other mods and treated like normal items.

It is so important now that I recommend including your cache folder on updates to your modpack, along with Textures, Objects, Icons

If a cloned is not cached for the first run, errors may appear for users as other mods try to touch a item that wasn't created until very late.

The next load logon should fix the issues. 

Feel free to removed the cache folder for big changes, but try to leave it for normal usage

![Materials and Custom](https://wackymole.com/hosts/FenringLiveChanging.gif)

  Please be patient with this documentation. There is a lot to this one and I am slowly trying to learn from Rexabyte. There may be inaccurate information here. </br>

 ### Useful tools

 https://rgbcolorpicker.com/0-1 

https://github.com/Wacky-Mole/WackysDatabase/tree/master/Documentation - You Are GOING TO NEED TO STUDY THIS!

 ### Structures


 Welcome to Rexabyte's Guide on Understanding Material Management by Wacky!

A Material is a powerful combination of a shader, texture, and color. For most items, a single material is sufficient, but more complex things like armors can utilize multiple materials.

To create a basic material, simply use the 'material' section and combine various _mats. Oh, by the way, "mat" or "mats" refer to materials and are often appended at the end of their names.

When describing an item's render using "wackydb_describe," you'll find the materials section with the current name of the mat.

To save or clone a material, employ the functions "wackydb_save_material [mat]" or "wackydb_clone [mat/material] [mat] [clonename]" The newly created material file can be found in the materials folder.

Now, let's get creative with adjustments! Most commonly, you'll be working with colors. Use https://rgbcolorpicker.com/0-1 to find the 0-1 values **RGBA**.

Textures play a vital role, particularly with armors and creatures. Remember, they are saved along with the material in PNG format. However, WackyDB won't automatically sync them, so you'll need to manually color or edit the texture files. Textures may use base vanilla ones like Red or Blue

Excitingly, changes to materials automatically update without requiring a reload. Icons, too, reflect these changes unless you opt for a custom icon.

For a shortcut, you can use vanilla materials by selecting one from the generated wackydb_material materials.txt file.

Lastly, a single material YAML (yml) can be applied to multiple items, creatures, or pieces. Keep in mind that some objects might need more information than others for proper display.

Now go forth, and let your creativity run wild with Rex's Material Management!

<details><summary> MOCK System </summary>

![Bike Model Import ](https://wackymole.com/hosts/bike.png)

https://github.com/Wacky-Mole/WackysDatabase/tree/master/Documentation/Mock%20Examples

Example Files and Item Yaml for Bike

All credits to @KG for making this incredible system.

In the Wackydatabase folder, there is the Object Folder.

Objects can only be items that you can pick up/trade at the moment, but mocks are limitless in the possibilities of what you can add.

Pick an object like bike.obj and bike_albedo.png and put them into the Object folder. It should load up the new GameObject at the start. You can then use wackydb_save_item to customize and/or create a recipe.

The object folder matches based on the preceding name, so bike_ matches to bike.

It looks for PNGs with "_albedo", "_metallic", and "_normal".

This system is not well tested, so please give me feedback and submit bug reports for any bugs.

<details><summary> 1.xx ChangeLog</summary>
        
        Version 1.4.2
            Had to disable Piece snapshot because of hovering pieces stacking up on each other, hopefully someone fixes it someday.

        Version 1.3.5
            I have decided to add more parameters to Json file, so please do not use older version of Wackydb after upgrading. Wackydb 2.0 is not coming soon
            Existing Jsons are fine to use, you can regenerate them to get new values. 
            Added m_EitrCost, m_secEitrCost - These are attack costs for primary and secondary weapon attacks, no Eitr, no swing. 
            m_FoodEitr - Food Eitr amount, m_EitrRegen- Modifier to Eitr Regen - Very powerful on clothes, weapons, added more warnings.

            Moved wackysDatabase to Config instead of Plugins folder to stop r2mod from deleting folder on updates.
            Warning 1.2.4 and Lower will delete wackysDatabase folder in Plugins on Update, please backup.
        Version 1.2.4 
            Expanded Recipe Compatibility to Recipe_ ( Modification only, no cloning),  Can now change any material's type,
            category, craftingstation instead of just clones. Cannot change piecehammer of non clones. You can now set the piece's 
            material at 50% health. If you only set 1 it sets to both "full health" and "half health" otherwise,

        Version 1.10
            All About Pieces with this Update!

<details><summary> Last notes</summary>

## Last notes:

 This mod loads at various places to ensure that it can touch all objects while allowing other mods to touch some wackydb clones.

 The primary purpose of this mod is to edit objects, not to create clones/mocks. - This is less true in 2.0

 A mispelling like "Like <colorz = blue> Hi</color>?" or dmg modifier that is wrong can break Azu show container contents

(Note!: If you want the game to have default values, close the game and delete the wackysDatabase folder).
