Description

WackysDatabase, or Wackydb, allows you to modify, create, customize: items, pieces, recipes, effects, materials, creatures, pickables in Valheim without coding. With this mod, you can **clone** items, change their colors, create new items, and even translate language. It offers a wide range of possibilities for customization.


YML Knowledge

    YML is easier to edit and change without getting confused on the syntac. 

 You can use https://www.yamllint.com/ to validate any yml code

    Almost every component of items/pieces/recipes/effects/creatures can be deleted.

    Some components are multilined where you can actually add your own stuff the ymls.

<details><summary>Installation</summary>
### Installation

    Download and extract the latest version of WackysDatabase into the BepInEx plugin folder (usually Valheim/BepInEx/plugins).
    Run Valheim and join a world.
    Go to Valheim/BepInEx/config/ and locate the "wackysDatabase" folder.
    Inside the "wackysDatabase" folder, you will find three subfolders: "Items," "Recipes," and "Pieces."
    Put the mod on the server to force server sync. The YAML files only need to be on the server. There's no need to share the YAML files.

For multiplayer, the mod has been locked down to prevent easy cheating. However, it is recommended to use the AzuAntiCheat and ServerCharacters mods for additional security.

<details><summary>General Knowledge</summary>


    There are seven (7) Objects that WackyDB touches. Items, Recipes, Pieces, Creatures, Pickables(Pickables and Treebase) Materials and Textures

    Items are things in your inventory, you can pickup and maybe equip them.

    Recipes are used to construct items, CraftingStations can be workbench, forge, or hand crafted (craftingStation": "")

    Pieces are what you use in your hammer and hoe to construct or plant. piecehammers

    Creatures are mobs, bosses ect.

    Pickable are plants that you can pick like mushrooms, carrots, flint, ect. When you pick a pickable, it gives you the item associated to it. 
    
    Treebase are the final tree grown.

    When you place pickable you are actually placing a piece in the (hoe usually). The piece controls how the plant will grow until it matures into a pickable. 

    Materials are the basic "colors" in the game, but hold a lot more than just RBG, can they can be tricky to get just right.

    Textures are .pngs that hold the feel, appearance, or consistency of a surface or substance.

    Most lines in the YAMLS can be deleted. Only the required ones need to be in the files, when the line is deleted the computer interprets that as a null value.

    Null is like, I don't know, so I don't care, use the orginal values. 
    
    To delete the existing values you will use either '' for strings, "delete" for SE Effects or "-" for multiliners. 

    jpeg or png. 64 x 64 px - name like wacky.png, Must be in Icon Folder (Not ServerSynced)

Frequently Asked Questions

    Q: Can I use custom icons for items?
        A: Yes, you can use autogenerated icons or provide JPEG/PNG icons (64x64) for customization.

    Q: Can I add new items with this mod?
        A: Yes, you can create new items and make them exclusive.

    Q: Can I remove components from YAML files?
        A: Yes, most components can be removed from the YAML files.

    Q: Is the mod future-proof?
        A: Yes, you can add or remove components without much hassle.

    Q: Does the Water resistant not work on set effect? Like m_mods: m_type: Water
        A: Water is a DamageModifiers that I added from Aedenthorn mod.  I don't have plans to add it to m_mods.
        
    Q: Do you have a Video;
        A: Not yet, but YOU could make one! Majestic has some short ones linked.

    Q: Is it possible to add a recipe for each upgrade of an item?
        A: You can now have a crafting recipe and an upgrading recipe. You can't have a different recipe for each upgrade, unless you do item cloning/recipe cloning hack.

    Q: My weapon clones are speedup/speed down. 
        A: The clones speed can change a little bit from their parents. Custom_AttackSpeed should always be 1 on a save. 
        If you notice a speed up or down a +- 0.1 should fix it.  
        FYI reminder that SpeedFactor deals with character movement speed while swinging/attacking and has nothing to do with speed of animation.

    Q: What Folders do I need to give to my users?
        A: Textures, Objects, Icons will NOT SYNC. I also recommend including the cache folder. Cache keeps track of Item/mock clones and materials

    Q: How can I export material without _mat suffix ? I succeeded to export draugr_mat, but how for goblin or greydwarves ? 
        A: It's is unfortunately not possible right now to get all of the mats because of how the devs named and made different things.
            If you have access to Unity you could look at the files themselves. 

    Q: What lines can I delete or how can I make somethings empty?
        A: This is a long answer, but most lines in the YAMLS can be deleted. Only the required ones need to be in the files, when the line is deleted the computer interprets that as a null value.
            Null is like I don't know, so I don't care, use the original values. To delete the existing values you will use either '' for strings, "delete" for SE Effects or "-" for multiliners. 

    Q: How do I make custom Icons?
        A: Make a png or jpeg 64 x 64 px. Put it in Icons folder. In the customIcon line, put the filename. ie. wacky.png

![Custom Icon Gif](https://wackymole.com/hosts/customicon.gif)


    Q: Will there be even MORE features and can I edit effects?
        A: Yes I guess, because I just keep adding MOAR. - Send help, I might have a problem. 

    Q: Why are some of the SE Effects empty? Like SeData?
        A: Well its complicated, I am having to grab them in a weird way, and not all SEs have SeData. Nothing to be done about it. 

    Q: What about Attack Projectile?
        A: I need to look at projectiles in the future, for now they are disabled.

    Q: Would it be possible to have one item take 2+ different item slots ? (say weapon + pants)
        A: No, but you can edit two parts and one effect, which is effective when combined!
        If one of them is missing, then the two pieces of equipment have no effect, which can be regarded as a limitation

    Q:  On an item "name" is the prefab name, "m_name" is the in game name? Then on recipes, "name" is the name of the prefab item name?
        A: For cloned recipes, it looks at cloneprefabname for item prefab name. For regular recipes the name points to the item. 

    Q: I can't repair spawned in Cloned items, how do I fix?
        A: Repairstation is set in the recipe, make a cloned recipe, and set to disable or change a req to SwordCheat. - 
        Wacky Later - I have no idea what I am trying to suggest here, but I am going to leave it for now. Do whatever makes it work.

    Q: How does Piece Snapshot work?
        A: Piece snapshot has given me a lot of problems so it only loads at Game.SpawnPlayer. If you do a wackydb_reload use the wackydb_snapshot command to reload snapshots. 

    Q: What is 0.0.1 Error message when I try to connect? I keep getting this one COOP.
        A: 0.0.1 is a security feature that prevents people loading into a singleplayer world and then immediately connecting to a multiplayer world. It does seem to have some problems in COOP.
            Just disable it on the server if you are having problems. ExtraSecurity = false

    Q: Can I clone or adjust Projectiles?
        A: No, wackydb doesn't do projectiles, it may someday.

    Q: Wackydb object failed hashes, Please fix yaml or Bug, removing from ObjectDB, rerunning
        A: So this can be any number of things. First make sure you clear your cache! It might mean that the yaml is not be correct,
             missing info/mods or I an actual bug I haven't fixed.  I usually only see it on relogging a character.
             Please clear your cache and if it is reproducible and not a basic yaml error, send me your log and yaml.

<details> <summary> Console Commands</summary>

## Console Commands

You will can reference https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/data/objects/item-list.html for Prefab names. Thank you JVL team

To use the console commands, press F5 in the game to open the game console. Make sure to enable the console for Valheim by adding "-console" to the launch options.

- `wackydb_reload`: Reloads all the YML files in the wackysDatabase folder. : This now works for admins on server now. So you could turn off Filewatcher and just do a manual reload on your client and forces all clients to reload. 
- `wackydb_reload_fast`: Fast reload that may cause game stutter.
- `wackydb_save_recipe [ItemName]`: Saves a recipe YML in the wackysDatabase Recipe folder.
- `wackydb_save_piece [PieceName]`: Saves a piece YML in the wackysDatabase Piece folder.
- `wackydb_save_item [ItemName]`: Saves an item YML in the wackysDatabase Item folder.
- `wackydb_save_creature [CreatureName]`: Saves a Creature YML in the wackysDatabase Creature folder.

- `wackydb_all_items`: Saves all items in the game into wackyDatabase-BulkYML.
- `wackydb_all_recipes`: Saves all recipes in the game into wackyDatabase-BulkYML.
- `wackydb_all_pieces [Hammer] [Optionally: Category]`: Saves all pieces in the game into wackyDatabase-BulkYML. Use 'Hammer' for default, or specify a different hammer name. Optionally, you can set a category to only get specific pieces in a cat.
- `wackydb_all_se`: Retrieves almost all status effects in the game (including modded effects) and saves them into the Effects folder.
- `wackydb_all_creatures`: Saves all creatures in game into Bulk Creature folder. (Not deer or birds?)
- `wackydb_all_pickables`: Saves all pickables(pickable and treebase) in Bulk Pickables folder.
- `wackydb_se [effectname]`: Retrieves a specific status effect and saves it into the Effect folder.
- `wackydb_se_create`: Creates a clone of SetEffect_TrollArmor in the Status folder. You can edit it as needed.
- `wackydb_help`: Shows a list of commands.
- `wackydb_clone [recipe/item/piece/creature/mat/materials/se/pickable/treebase] [Prefab to clone] [Unique name for the clone]`: Clones an object and changes it differently than a base game object. For example: `wackydb_clone item SwordIron WackySword`.

--There is a optional 4th parameter for clone RECIPES ONLY [original item prefab to use for recipe](Optional 4th parameter for a cloned item's recipes ONLY)
--For example you can already have item WackySword loaded in game, but now want a recipe. WackySword Uses SwordIron  - wackydb_clone recipe WackySword RWackySword SwordIron - otherwise manually edit
--Extremely powerful command that allows you design your world however you would like. 

- `wackydb_clone_recipeitem [Prefab to clone] [clone name]`: Clones an item and recipe at the same time. The recipe name will be Rname.
- `wackydb_vfx`: Saves a vfx.txt file with all vfx effects

- `wackydb_describe[ObjectName]`: Saves describe of an object, so you have an idea of the structure of the object for materials and customVisuals
- `wackydb_sendtheload` : Experimental command that will send pngs and objs to clients utilizing ServerSync. I recommend the Network mod to uncap datarates. 
- `wackydb_get_piecehammers`: Saves all hammers, currently in your game to Hammer.txt file
- `wackydb_material` : Generate a text file of all <Material> Gameobjects in vanilla game. Saves to text

<details><summary> Cache System and Loading Order</summary>


<img src="https://wackymole.com/hosts/MainMenu.png" />

## Cache Folder


The cache system is very important for Item/mock clones and SEs. 

It allows material colors to show up on main menu and allows cloned items to be touched by other mods and treated like normal items.

It is so important now that I recommend including your cache folder on updates to your modpack, along with Textures, Objects, Icons

If a cloned is not cached for the first run, errors may appear for users as other mods try to touch a item that wasn't created until very late.

The next load logon should fix the issues. 

Feel free to removed the cache folder for big changes, but try to leave it for normal usage. If you see any hash errors, remove cache.

</br>

## Loading Order

This only really applies to other mods and sometimes server admins

Wackydb mod will load towards the end of the startup but that doesn't matter. The question is where to load the files and clones.

Too early and you won't get the files from the server/ Too late and you miss out on generating important things. 

Cache clones are loaded in ZNetScene.Awake and ObjectDB.awake

Dedicated Servers (With DedLoad ON) and Servers( COOP server) and SOLO Clients load at ZoneSystem.Start [HarmonyPriority(Priority.HigherThanNormal)]

Connecting Clients load at Game._RequestRespawn [HarmonyPriority(Priority.Low)] ( always consistent is pretty important)

Console wackydb_reload /_fast - always reload immediately. 

Anyway, it's hard to find a good spot so that you touch all base objects and not too late to add the clones.

![Materials and Custom](https://wackymole.com/hosts/FenringLiveChanging.gif)

  Please be patient with this documentation. There is a lot to this one and I am slowly trying to learn from Rexabyte. There may be inaccurate information here. </br>

 ### Useful tools

 https://rgbcolorpicker.com/0-1 

https://github.com/Wacky-Mole/WackysDatabase/tree/master/Documentation - You Are GOING TO NEED TO STUDY THIS!

 ### Structures


 Welcome to Rexabyte's Guide on Understanding Material Management by Wacky!

A Material is a powerful combination of a shader, texture, and color. For most items, a single material is sufficient, but more complex things like armors can utilize multiple materials.

To create a basic material, simply use the 'material' section and combine various _mats. Oh, by the way, "mat" or "mats" refer to materials and are often appended at the end of their names.

When describing an item's render using "wackydb_describe," you'll find the materials section with the current name of the mat.

To save or clone a material, employ the functions "wackydb_save_material [mat]" or "wackydb_clone [mat/material] [mat] [clonename]" The newly created material file can be found in the materials folder.

Now, let's get creative with adjustments! Most commonly, you'll be working with colors. Use https://rgbcolorpicker.com/0-1 to find the 0-1 values **RGBA**.

Textures play a vital role, particularly with armors and creatures. Remember, they are saved along with the material in PNG format. However, WackyDB won't automatically sync them, so you'll need to manually color or edit the texture files. Textures may use base vanilla ones like Red or Blue

Excitingly, changes to materials automatically update without requiring a reload. Icons, too, reflect these changes unless you opt for a custom icon.

For a shortcut, you can use vanilla materials by selecting one from the generated wackydb_material materials.txt file.

Lastly, a single material YAML (yml) can be applied to multiple items, creatures, or pieces. Keep in mind that some objects might need more information than others for proper display.

Now go forth, and let your creativity run wild with Rex's Material Management!




![Materials and Custom](https://wackymole.com/hosts/wackyDescribe.png)


### Materials and CustomVisuals

- `material` (string, optional): The name of the material
- `customVisual` (CustomVisual, optional): A more specific targetting for materials, generally only useful for player armors.

### Material Definition
- `name` (string, required): The name of the new material created
- `original` (string, required): The name of the material to clone from
- `overwrite` (boolean, optional): True to overwrite the original material.
- `changes` (MaterialChanges, required): The set of changes to apply to the material

### Material Changes Definition
- `colors` (Dictionary<MaterialProperty: string, MaterialValue: Array<int>[4]>, optional) : A collection of keys (property names) and their associated value. The value is in array format [RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA]. Values should range from 0 to 1 but can exceed 1.
- `floats` (Dictionary<MaterialProperty: string, MaterialValue: float>, optional): A collection of keys (property names) and their associated float value. The value can be any float value but it is recommended to stay within the range specified by describing the prefab that has this material.
- `textures` (Dictionary<MaterialProperty: string, MaterialValue: string>, optional): A collection of keys (property names) and their associated string value. The string value is the name of the texture to be used. The image should be a .png file stores in the 'Textures' section in the configuration folder. Do not include '.png', if the file is `my_texture.png` specify `my_texture` as the value here.
</br> </br> Inside of Textures you can also set filterMode: Point(default), Trilinear,Bilinear. </br>

                    _MainTex:
                      name: Oven_d
                      filterMode: Trilinear

### Custom Visual Definition
- `base_mat`: (string, optional): The name of the material, generally this applies to the model for the prefab.
- `chest`: (string, optional): The name of the material, generally this is only useful for chest armor. It will use the texture assigned to the "_ChestTex" property of the material.
- `legs`: (string. optional): The name of the material, generally this is only useful for leg armor. It will use the texture assigned to the "_LegsTex" property of the material.

![Materials and Custom](https://wackymole.com/hosts/rexExplain.png)

</br></br>

Public Service Annoucement: I just create a copy of the material with a new texture (mat1, mat2, mat3... ) and when I find the right one, I keep it and delete the rest. This allows you to not have to restart the game for texture changes.

<details><summary>Materials and CustomVisuals By Lughbaloo</summary>
####  Guide by Lughbaloo
</br>

#### The Way Items Render </br>

The way an item looks falls into two categories: its `Model`, and its `Render`. </br> A `Model` describes the three-dimensional shape of the item. A `Render` describes the visual appearance of that 3D model and consists of one or more `Materials`. `Materials` have associated `Shaders` and `Properties`. WackyDB can clone EXISTING `Materials` and their associated shaders/properties, but it cannot create brand new materials with an associated shader. It also cannot add/remove properties to existing materials. These are important considerations when making custom materials with WackyDB.
</br></br>Most items in Valheim use a single `Material`, but more complex things like armors can utilize multiple materials. And remember, each material has associated `Shaders` and `Properties`. Manipulating this can affect values like glossiness, metallic shine, emissions, and bumpiness.
#### Knowing where to look
</br>The first step is to find out more information about a material. In the examples, we'll compare the Two Handed Swords Krom and Slayer and learn what is different between them. Run the following command in-game.
</br></br>'Wackydb_describe [Item or Prefab name]'</br></br>
Examples:
'wackydb_describe THSwordKrom' </br></br>
'wackydb_describe THSwordSlayer'</br></br>
This will create 2 new files in your config/wackydatabase/ folder, called Describe_THSSwordKrom.yml and Describe_THSwordSlayer.yml. These files list every material the item uses, the shader associated with that material, and the properties of that material. Both of these items have only 1 material, which is listed at the top. This material name is what we'll clone. To clone these materials, go back in-game and run the following command.
</br></br>[wackydb_clone material [Material] [ClonedMaterial]</br></br>
Examples:
</br></br>'wackydb_clone material Krom_mat Krom_mat_clone`
</br></br>'wackydb_clone material NiedhoggSlayer_mat NiedhoggSlayer_mat'
#### Materials and their values</br></br>
Materials are a list of values that are used to dictate what an item looks like. When you clone a material, it will save a Material yml file in the wackyDatabase/Materials/ folder. These material files list different variables, and depending on the shader that the original material used, you may have different variables. In the example using Krom and Slayer, note that Krom has RGBA values for MetalColor, while Slayer has an EmissionMap. Depending on what you're trying to accomplish with your item, it is recommended to experiment with different donor materials for the values you want.
</br></br>Most commonly, you'll be working with colors. You can make adjustments to the _Colors RGBA values to overlay the color of your item. Do note that all values of 1 equals white, and will be the brightest version of the weapon. Use https://rgbcolorpicker.com/0-1 to find the 0-1 values RGBA.
</br></br>Your Glossiness value will determine how shiny your item is in-game; how much it reflects light. A Metallic value will determine how metallic a part looks. This will also darken the material quite a bit. 

There are many other values here you can change depending on the shader from the original material. Some examples are how impactful the Bump map is, the color of your metallic parts, what texture channel you use, and more. Another important consideration is that a lot of these values are referencing values within Unity, and a value of 0-1 doesn't necessarily equate on/off. An example is the SmoothnessTextureChannel: a value of 0 means "Metallic alpha" where a value of 1 means "Albedo alpha".
#### Let's talk about maps.</br></br>
Maps are a type of texture file, saved as a .png file. When you clone a material, it will save these texture maps in the wackyDatabase/Textures/ folder. Most of these texture maps can be edited in any paint program. Further, the resolution of each of these maps scales automatically, so you can increase the resolution of a map to increase the level of detail on an item. 

</br></br>MainTex: Also known as an Albedo map, this is the primary texture map for colors and design. These maps are sometimes denoted by the letter "d".

</br></br>MetallicGloss: Also known as a Metal map or Metallic map, this map is either a grayscale map or an Transparency map (Alpha map) used to dictate which parts of the item appear metallic or glossy. The more towards white on the map, the more metallic on the texture. These maps are sometimes denoted by the letter "m".

</br></br>BumpMap: Also known as a Normal map, this texture map uses either grayscale, alpha, or RGB channels to dictate roughness on the item. These maps are sometimes denoted by the letter "n". You will not likely be editing these, as you'll need to use Blender or some other tool  like https://smart-page.net/smartnormal/ to effectively create them.

</br></br>missionMap: The Emissive map is used to dictate a simulated light effect from the item using a grayscale map. The more towards white on the map, the brighter the texture on the item. Note this is not an actual light-source. But you will be able to see it in the dark. These maps are sometimes denoted by the letter "e".

<details><summary> MOCK System </summary>

![Bike Model Import ](https://wackymole.com/hosts/bike.png)

https://github.com/Wacky-Mole/WackysDatabase/tree/master/Documentation/Mock%20Examples

Example Files and Item Yaml for Bike

All credits to @KG for making this incredible system.

In the Wackydatabase folder, there is the Object Folder.

Objects can only be items that you can pick up/trade at the moment, but mocks are limitless in the possibilities of what you can add.

Pick an object like bike.obj and bike_albedo.png and put them into the Object folder. It should load up the new GameObject at the start. You can then use wackydb_save_item to customize and/or create a recipe.

The object folder matches based on the preceding name, so bike_ matches to bike.

It looks for PNGs with "_albedo", "_metallic", and "_normal".

Auto Gens Icon

This system is not well tested, so please give me feedback and submit bug reports for any bugs. 

2.3.1, I made default material as wood. I think it can be overwritten, but I am unsure.

<details><summary> 1.xx ChangeLog</summary>
        

        Version 1.4.2
            Had to disable Piece snapshot because of hovering pieces stacking up on each other, hopefully someone fixes it someday.

        Version 1.4.1
            Some items don't like snapshot icons - Added extra checks and only items with material changes get new icons
        Version 1.4.0
            Added DedServer load Memory config to allow people to see if loading Wackydb on DedServer helps or hinders. 
            extraSecurity - Allows people who don't want the extra cheat protection to disable it and not get 0.0.1 Error
            Big News! Added auto Icon Generation to cloned Items, and all Pieces with custom material(pieces angles are a little wonky or wacky if you will) - Thx Blaxx for code
        Version 1.3.6
            Added m_attackHealthPercentage and m_secAttackHealthPercentage- Warning any Items that uses this Must be recreated. s
            Otherwise default will go to 0. These items include the staffs that use a percentage of player health to power. 
        Version 1.3.5
            I have decided to add more parameters to Json file, so please do not use older version of Wackydb after upgrading. Wackydb 2.0 is not coming soon
            Existing Jsons are fine to use, you can regenerate them to get new values. 
            Added m_EitrCost, m_secEitrCost - These are attack costs for primary and secondary weapon attacks, no Eitr, no swing. 
            m_FoodEitr - Food Eitr amount, m_EitrRegen- Modifier to Eitr Regen - Very powerful on clothes, weapons, added more warnings.

            Destroyer is spelled with "troy", also now a loginfo instead of warning
        Version 1.2.5
            Moved wackysDatabase to Config instead of Plugins folder to stop r2mod from deleting folder on updates.
            Warning 1.2.4 and Lower will delete wackysDatabase folder in Plugins on Update, please backup.
        Version 1.2.4 
            Expanded Recipe Compatibility to Recipe_ ( Modification only, no cloning),  Can now change any material's type,
            category, craftingstation instead of just clones. Cannot change piecehammer of non clones. You can now set the piece's 
            material at 50% health. If you only set 1 it sets to both "full health" and "half health" otherwise,
            "material1, material2" (full, half health). "same_mat" or "no_wear" sets pieces to have no wear material.

        Version 1.10
            All About Pieces with this Update!

                - The CraftingStation name is "name", add recipes to it with this name.
            Fixed other mods custom pieces. You should be able access and even clone other mods pieces now.
            Added piecehammerCategory so you can change the category where piece appears on the hammer. 
                - Mods might use numbers instead of words though.

## Last notes:

 This mod loads at various places to ensure that it can touch all objects while allowing other mods to touch some wackydb clones.

 The primary purpose of this mod is to edit objects, not to create clones/mocks. - This is less true in 2.0

 A mispelling like "Like <colorz = blue> Hi</color>?" or dmg modifier that is wrong can break Azu show container contents

(Note!: If you want the game to have default values, close the game and delete the wackysDatabase folder).

If you null out piece WearNTearData, unexpected things might happen to your world.

Known issues: </br>
 Bug on moving stuff from one hammer to another - It may work/ It may not - disable orginal and make a clone for now
 </br> 
 </br> 
 Creature material is not working
 </br>
 </br>
 CrossbowArbalest item not changing, recommend cloning and replacing. - If anyone has any ideas on this one, please let me know.
 </br>
 </br>
 Making any piece into a craftingstation is a bit buggy. (It's really at the limit to what wackydb can do without Unity)
 </br>
 </br>
 Piece snapshot sometimes doesn't work and spawns pieces below ground, apparently they can break and the items rise to the surface. </br>
 While I can't fix the main issue right now, you can resolve the issue by not using piece snapshot and use customIcons for any material changes.
 </br>
Stay Wacky.
